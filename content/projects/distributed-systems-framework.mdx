title: Distributed Systems Framework
description: A high-performance framework for building scalable distributed applications with built-in fault tolerance and load balancing.
tags: [Systems, Web, Backend]

problem: Building distributed systems requires significant boilerplate code for handling failures, load balancing, and state management. Existing solutions are either too opinionated or lack critical features.
approach: Designed a framework that abstracts common distributed systems patterns while remaining flexible. Implemented a consensus algorithm for state synchronization and a pluggable load balancing system. Built comprehensive monitoring and observability tools.
results: Reduced development time for distributed applications by 40%. The framework handles 10M+ requests per day with 99.9% uptime. Adopted by 3 internal teams.
techStack: [Go, gRPC, Kubernetes, Prometheus, Redis]

A framework designed to simplify building robust distributed systems.

## Architecture

The framework provides:

- Automatic service discovery
- Built-in retry and circuit breaker patterns
- Distributed tracing
- Health check endpoints
