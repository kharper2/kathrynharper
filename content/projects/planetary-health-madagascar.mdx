title: Planetary Health Data Science — Madagascar & Nepal
description: Research with Golden Lab's Planetary Health Research Group at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health analyzing climate-linked health impacts. Compiled and validated datasets of harmful algal blooms and marine intoxication events with geocoordinates, then linked outbreaks to ocean-color and environmental satellite data to study warning lead times. Analyzed relationships between drought/cyclones and malnutrition/mental health, sea temperature rise and harmful algal blooms, deforestation and vector-borne disease, and wildfire-driven air pollution impacts on stillbirth and acute respiratory infections.
