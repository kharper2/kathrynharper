  def predict_diagnosis(patient_data):
      # Ensemble model combining CNN and XGBoost
      cnn_pred = cnn_model.predict(patient_data.vitals)
      xgb_pred = xgb_model.predict(patient_data.features)
      
      # Weighted ensemble
      final_pred = 0.6 * cnn_pred + 0.4 * xgb_pred
      return interpret_results(final_pred)
problem: Healthcare providers face challenges in early disease detection, especially in resource-constrained settings. Traditional diagnostic methods can be time-consuming and may miss subtle patterns in patient data.
approach: Developed an ensemble model combining deep learning and traditional ML approaches to analyze patient vitals, lab results, and medical history. The system provides probability scores for various conditions while maintaining interpretability through feature importance visualization.
results: Achieved 94% accuracy in early detection across 5 disease categories, reducing diagnostic time by 60% in pilot studies. The system is currently being evaluated in 3 clinical settings.
