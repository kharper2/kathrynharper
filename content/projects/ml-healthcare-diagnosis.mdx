title: ML-Powered Healthcare Diagnosis System
description: A machine learning system that assists healthcare providers in early disease detection using patient data analysis.
tags: [ML, Health, Systems]
date: 2024-01-15
problem: Healthcare providers face challenges in early disease detection, especially in resource-constrained settings. Traditional diagnostic methods can be time-consuming and may miss subtle patterns in patient data.
approach: Developed an ensemble model combining deep learning and traditional ML approaches to analyze patient vitals, lab results, and medical history. The system provides probability scores for various conditions while maintaining interpretability through feature importance visualization.
results: Achieved 94% accuracy in early detection across 5 disease categories, reducing diagnostic time by 60% in pilot studies. The system is currently being evaluated in 3 clinical settings.
techStack: [Python, PyTorch, scikit-learn, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Docker]
