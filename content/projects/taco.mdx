title: "TACO: Multimodal Image Compression with Cross-Modal Attention Analysis"
description: Research project analyzing how cross-modal attention mechanisms affect multimodal image compression. Built evaluation framework to systematically test attention ablations and visualization tools to inspect model behavior. Conducted experiments on 600+ images across 25 conditions, finding that architectural regularization effects drive performance improvements more than caption content at inference.
