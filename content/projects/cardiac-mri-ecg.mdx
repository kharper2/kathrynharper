title: Cardiac MRI Inference from ECG
description: Ongoing research with MIT's Computational Cardiovascular Research Group on representation learning for cardiology—predicting MRI-relevant cardiac phenotypes from ECG-derived signals. Building the data pipeline, modeling stack, and evaluation framework focused on generalization, failure modes, and clinical interpretability. The lab uses machine learning and signal processing to turn clinical signals like ECGs into predictive computational biomarkers and risk models that guide clinical decisions.
